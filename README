# Instructions:

## Extract
In order to run extract.py you need to pass the following arguments in command-line:
extract.py file_to_predict_on train_file_path_txt train_annotations_path output_filename
- file_to_predict_on - path to the file to extract the features from, this file is in txt-format (not processed)
- train_file_path_txt - path to the train file, txt (not processed)
- train_annotations_path - path to annotations-file of train
- output_filename - name of the output-file, will contain the relations that the model extracted

For example, to extract from the dev-file, run the next:
python2.7 extract.py Corpus.DEV.txt Corpus.TRAIN.txt TRAIN.annotations output.dev.txt

## Eval
In order to run eval.py you need to pass the following arguments in command-line:
eval.py gold_file_path pred_file_path
- gold_file_path - path to the gold-file (.annotations file) which contains all the true relations
- pred_file_path - path to the output-file of extract.py, should be the same string as passed to extract.py as output_filename

For example, to evaluate the dev-file-output from earlier, run the next:
python2.7 eval.py DEV.annotations output.dev.txt
